    <h2>My name is Reggie, and I'm here to kick ass and take names.</h2>

    <p style="margin: 2px;">Former <span class="bold">President of Nintendo of America</span>, professional name-taker, ass-kicker, and proud owner of the phrase “My body is ready.”</p>
    <p style="margin: 2px;">Before I was meme’d into gaming history, I was just a kid from the Bronx trying to figure out how to take over the <span class="bold">business world</span> one bold move at a time.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">I’ve worked in fast food, soft drinks, TV networks, and, eventually, video games — which means I’ve basically<span class="bold">mastered every form of dopamine delivery</span>  known to mankind.</p>
    <p style="margin: 2px;">In 2004, I walked onto the E3 stage and said a sentence that made the internet lose its collective mind. It turns out the gaming world was very ready for me.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">A year later, I became <span class="bold">President and COO of Nintendo of America</span> and spent the next 13+ years helping launch consoles you’ve probably lost hundreds of hours to — Wii, DS, 3DS, Switch… you're welcome.</p>
    <p style="margin: 2px;">I didn’t make the games, but <span class="bold">I made you care about them.</span> My job was to make sure Nintendo’s magic made it to your living room — and to occasionally say something outrageous on stage while doing it.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">These days, I’m retired (in theory), but I still speak at universities, serve on boards, mentor leaders, and tweet like your favorite uncle who just discovered LinkedIn.</p>
    <p style="margin: 2px;">I also wrote a book <span class="bold">— Disrupting the Game —</span> where I explain how I went from the Bronx to the big leagues, and how you can too.</p>
