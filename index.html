   <h2>My name is Reggie, and I'm here to kick ass and take names.</h2>
   <p>Former President of Nintendo of America, professional name-taker, ass-kicker, and proud owner of the phrase “My body is ready.”</p>
    <p>Before I was meme’d into gaming history, I was just a kid from the Bronx trying to figure out how to take over the business world one bold move at a time. I’ve worked in fast food, soft drinks, TV networks, and, eventually, video games — which means I’ve basically mastered every form of dopamine delivery known to mankind.</p>
    <p>In 2004, I walked onto the E3 stage and said a sentence that made the internet lose its collective mind. It turns out the gaming world was very ready for me. A year later, I became President and COO of Nintendo of America and spent the next 13+ years helping launch consoles you’ve probably lost hundreds of hours to — Wii, DS, 3DS, Switch… you're welcome.</p>
    <p>I didn’t make the games, but I made you care about them. My job was to make sure Nintendo’s magic made it to your living room — and to occasionally say something outrageous on stage while doing it.</p>
    <p>These days, I’m retired <span style="color: rgb(93, 93, 93);">(in theory)</span>, but I still speak at universities, serve on boards, mentor leaders, and tweet like your favorite uncle who just discovered LinkedIn. I also wrote a book — Disrupting the Game — where I explain how I went from the Bronx to the big leagues, and how you can too.</p>
